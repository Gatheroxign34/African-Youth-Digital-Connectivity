    <h1> What percentage of upper secondary school students in African countries are digitally connected? </h1>
        <p> This project explores this question using UNICEF data with Salesforce Tableau </p>
        <p> Inquiry: Grouped data on African youth in 2018-2019 to better understand the distribution of access to technology based on geographic  
        location, and factors such as income level and population density.</p> 
        <p> Methods & Tools: In the final Tableau dashboard, instituted three colors for heatmaps, charts, and a map of the continent of Africa
        to highlight the relative location of youth and their digital connectivity.</p>
        <p> Analysis: Determined that the region of Africa (North, Central and South) plays a role in overall rates of digital connectivity. Further 
        showcased that urban versus rural territories within African countries contribute to higher rates of connectivity. And, rich versus poor 
        areas of African countries also affect the rate of youth connectivity.</p>
        <p> Recommendation: When looking for insights into the digital divide in Africa look closely as regional patterns of connectivity; 
        include infrastructural differences as well as socioeconomic differences.
